		<p><i>Let's go<br>
		Steve walks warily down the street
		<br>With his brim pulled way down low
		<br>Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
		<br>Machine guns ready to go
		<br>Are you ready hey are you ready for this?
		<br>Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
		<br>Out of the doorway the bullets rip
		<br>To the sound of the beat yeah</i></p>
		<p><b>Another one bites the dust<br>
		Another one bites the dust
		<br>And another one gone and another one gone
		<br>Another one bites the dust
		<br>Hey I'm gonna get you too
		Another one bites the dust</b></p>
		<p><i>How do you think I'm going to get along
		<br>Without you when you're gone
		<br>You took me for everything that I had
		<br>And kicked me out on my own
		<br>Are you happy are you satisfied?
		<br>How long can you stand the heat
		<br>Out of the doorway the bullets rip
		To the sound of the beat look out</i></p>
		<p><b>Another one bites the dust
		<br>Another one bites the dust
		<br>And another one gone and another one gone
		<br>Another one bites the dust
		<br>Hey I'm gonna get you too
